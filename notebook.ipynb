    "Vehicle accidents are a major source of worry for public safety and transportation agencies. They not only cause death and property damage, but also interrupt traffic flow and incur economic losses. Understanding the factors that contribute to these collisions and their effects is critical for putting effective measures in place to decrease their occurrence and impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Chicago has collected extensive crash data through its electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash), providing a valuable resource to analyse and gain insights into the factors contributing to accidents. The dataset comprises a wide range of crash parameters, including crash circumstances, vehicles involved, and people affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is to analyse the dataset and provide a full understanding of car crashes and their characteristics in the city of Chicago. We hope to discover key factors that contribute to collisions, measure the impact they have, and analyse the circumstances surrounding the accidents by studying the numerous characteristics associated with each crash event.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project's target audience includes numerous road safety stakeholders such as transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and insurance companies. Decision-makers can establish focused plans and activities to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents by knowing the fundamental elements that contribute to collisions."

    "The city of Chicago maintains an electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) which shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data from the CPD's electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) are displayed without any identifying information. When a crash report is completed or when an existing report in E-Crash receives updates, records are added to the data portal. The drivers involved in most minor incidents self-report about half of all crash reports to the police station, while the other half are documented on the scene by the responding police officer. The reporting officer records several crash parameters, such as information on street conditions, weather, and posted speed restrictions, based on the best information at the moment, but many of these may conflict with posted data or other assessments of road conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset offers useful information for evaluating traffic incidents, spotting patterns, and putting safety measures in place to lower casualties and improve road safety. This information can be used by researchers, decision-makers, and analysts to make more informed choices and enhance overall road transportation systems. The goal of this research is to create a categorization model that will aid in determining the characteristics of an automobile collision that are significant."
